# Heat-Exchanger-Design-and-analysis-Tool
# Heat Exchanger Design & Analysis Tool

A comprehensive web-based application for thermal analysis and design of heat exchangers using multiple engineering methodologies.

## Overview

This tool provides chemical engineers, students, and researchers with a powerful platform for designing and analyzing heat exchangers through four established methods:

- **LMTD Method**: For calculating heat transfer area when inlet/outlet temperatures are known
- **Effectiveness-NTU Method**: For determining heat exchanger performance when outlet temperatures are unknown
- **Kern Method**: Simplified approach for shell-and-tube heat exchanger design
- **Fin Analysis**: Extended surface heat transfer analysis for various fin geometries

## Features

- Interactive input forms for all thermal parameters
- Real-time calculations and visualizations
- Performance comparison across different configurations
- Detailed graphical outputs including temperature profiles and efficiency curves
- Example data loading for quick experimentation
- Comprehensive results display with engineering metrics

## Technologies Used

- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- Bootstrap 5 for responsive UI components
- Plotly.js for interactive data visualizations
- Modern CSS styling for professional appearance

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser
2. Navigate between different analysis methods using the tab interface

## Methods Implemented

### LMTD Method
Calculates the required heat transfer area using the Log Mean Temperature Difference approach for parallel flow, counter flow, and shell-and-tube configurations.

### Effectiveness-NTU Method
Determines heat exchanger effectiveness and outlet temperatures using the Number of Transfer Units method.

### Kern Method
Provides simplified calculations for shell-and-tube heat exchangers including tube and shell side heat transfer coefficients.

### Fin Analysis
Analyzes extended surface heat transfer for rectangular, triangular, and pin fins with efficiency calculations.
